I am María Inés, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bonn, working in the workgroup on Formal Mathematics led by <a href="https://florisvandoorn.com/" target="_blank">Floris van Doorn</a>. Previously, I worked as a Margarita Salas Postdoctoral Researcher at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/danielmaciascastillo" target="_blank">Daniel Macias Castillo</a>.) and as a Research Associate at Imperial College London, in <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.buzzard" target="_blank">Kevin Buzzard</a>'s’s research group. Before joining Imperial College, I worked as an Assistant Professor (Profesor Ayudante Doctor) at Universidad Nebrija. I earned my PhD in Mathematics from Boston University in 2020, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jared-weinstein/home" target="_blank">Jared Weinstein</a>.

My main research interests are mathematical formalization and number theory.

Here is my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Maria_Ines_de_Frutos_Fernandez.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
