  abstract    = { We present some cryptographical applications of the discrete logarithm problem over 
  elliptic curves, including Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Massey-Omura encryption and ECDSA digital
signatures. We analyze some general attacks on the DLP: Baby-Step Giant-Step, Pollard's rho
algorithm and Silver-Pohlig-Hellman attack. We also describe two specifics attacks: the
subexponential algorithm Index Calculus, which works over $F_q^*$, and Xedni Calculus, which is an
attack on the DLP over elliptic curves. Finally, we compare the performances of several attacks
over $F_q^*$ and $E(F_q)$: Baby-Step Giant-Step, four variants of Pollard's rho method and Index
Calculus (the last one, only over $F_q^*$). We conclude that, on groups of the sizes we consider,
Pollard's rho attack works best for computing isolated logarithms, while Index Calculus is the
fastest method when several attacks need to be made. }
