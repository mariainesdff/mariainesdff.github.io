  abstract    = {The field $R$ of real numbers is obtained from the rational numbers 
  ${Q}$ by taking the completion with respect to the usual absolute value. We then define the 
  complex numbers ${C}$ as an algebraic closure of ${R}$. The p-adic analogue of the real numbers
  is the field ${Q}_p$ of p-adic numbers, obtained by completing ${Q}$ with respect to the p-adic norm. 
  In this paper, we formalize in Lean 3 the definition of the p-adic analogue of the complex numbers, which is the field 
  ${C}_p$ of p-adic complex numbers, a field extension of ${Q}_p$ which is both algebraically closed 
  and complete with respect to the extension of the p-adic norm.
More generally, given a field K complete with respect to a nonarchimedean real-valued norm, and an algebraic field extension L/K, we show that there is a unique norm on L extending the given norm on K, with an explicit description.
Building on the definition of ${C}_p$, we formalize the definition of the Fontaine period ring $B_{HT}$ and discuss some applications to the theory of Galois representations and to p-adic Hodge theory.
The results formalized in this paper are a prerequisite to formalize Local Class Field Theory, which is a fundamental ingredient of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. }

  abstract    = {Local fields, and fields complete with respect to a discrete valuation, are essential
  objects in commutative algebra, with applications to number theory and algebraic geometry. We formalize
  in Lean the basic theory of discretely valued fields. In particular, we prove that the unit ball with
  respect to a discrete valuation on a field is a discrete valuation ring and, conversely, that the adic
  valuation on the field of fractions of a discrete valuation ring is discrete. We define finite 
  extensions of valuations and of discrete valuation rings, and prove some global-to-local results. 
  
  Building on this general theory, we formalize the abstract definition and some fundamental properties 
  of local fields. As an application, we show that finite extensions of the field ${Q}_p$ of p-adic 
  numbers and of the field ${F}_p((X))$ of Laurent series over ${F}_p$ are local fields. }

 line with Γ(N), Γ_1(N) and Γ_0(N) level structures, where N is an effective divisor on $P^1$. 
 If the degree of N is big enough, these moduli spaces are relative surfaces. We study how the 
 moduli space of shtukas over P1 with Γ_0(N) level structure, $Sht^\{2,tr\}(Γ_0(N))$, can be used to 
 provide a notion of motivic modularity for elliptic curves defined over function fields. Elliptic
 curves over function fields are known to be modular in the sense of admitting a parametrization 
 from a Drinfeld modular curve, provided that they have split multiplicative reduction at one place.
 We conjecture a different notion of modularity that should cover the curves excluded by the
 reduction hypothesis. We use our explicit equations for $Sht^\{2,tr\}(Γ_0(N))$ to verify our 
 modularity conjecture in the cases where N = 2(0) + (1) + (∞) and N = 3(0) + (∞).},

signatures. We analyze some general attacks on the DLP: Baby-Step Giant-Step, Pollard's rho
algorithm and Silver-Pohlig-Hellman attack. We also describe two specifics attacks: the
subexponential algorithm Index Calculus, which works over $F_q^*$, and Xedni Calculus, which is an
attack on the DLP over elliptic curves. Finally, we compare the performances of several attacks
over $F_q^*$ and $E(F_q)$: Baby-Step Giant-Step, four variants of Pollard's rho method and Index
Calculus (the last one, only over $F_q^*$). We conclude that, on groups of the sizes we consider,
Pollard's rho attack works best for computing isolated logarithms, while Index Calculus is the
fastest method when several attacks need to be made. }
